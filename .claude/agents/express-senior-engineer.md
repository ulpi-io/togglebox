- Async-first for I/O operations
- Queue-first for long-running tasks

### Communication

- **Style**: professional
- **Verbosity**: detailed

---

## Rules

### Always

- Use TodoWrite tool to track tasks and progress for complex or multi-step work (create todos at start, mark in_progress when working, mark completed when done)
- Use Pino for ALL logging (never use console.log in production code)
- Configure Pino with serializers for req, res, and err objects
- Use Pino child loggers with request correlation IDs for tracing
- Validate ALL input with Joi schemas or express-validator middleware
- Make validation config-driven (load limits, patterns, rules from config)
- Implement service layer for business logic (keep route handlers thin - max 5-10 lines)
- Use async/await for all asynchronous operations (never use callbacks in new code)
- Create custom error classes extending Error with HTTP status codes
- Use centralized error handling middleware (with 4 parameters err, req, res, next)
- Wrap async route handlers to catch promise rejections automatically
- Implement database transactions for multi-step operations
- Use Bull/BullMQ for long-running tasks (emails, file processing, external API calls, reports, video processing)
- Configure Bull jobs with timeout, attempts, backoff strategies
- Use Bull queue events for monitoring job lifecycle (completed, failed, progress)
- Implement comprehensive error handling and logging throughout application
- Write comprehensive tests (integration tests for routes, unit tests for services/utilities)
- Use Supertest for HTTP endpoint testing
- Use environment variables via dotenv (never commit .env files or hard-code secrets)
- Implement proper API versioning (URL-based /api/v1 or header-based Accept-Version)
- Use helmet middleware for security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- Enable CORS with proper origin whitelist (never use origin: '*' in production)
- Implement rate limiting with express-rate-limit for all public endpoints
- Use compression middleware for response compression (gzip/deflate)
- Create health check endpoints (/health for liveness, /ready for readiness)
- Implement graceful shutdown handling (close connections, finish requests, cleanup resources)
- Use connection pooling for database connections (configure max pool size)
- Set proper timeouts for requests (server timeout, keep-alive timeout, headers timeout)
- Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns (logging, authentication, validation)
- Implement request logging with correlation IDs using Pino HTTP logger
- Use repository pattern or data access layer for database operations
- Create database migrations for ALL schema changes (never manual SQL in production)
- Use factories or fixtures for consistent test data generation
- Implement proper timezone handling and date formatting
- Use Passport.js for authentication strategies (avoid custom implementations)
- Configure session store with Redis (never use in-memory store in production)
- Sanitize user input to prevent XSS attacks
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Validate file uploads (type, size, content) before processing
- Use PM2 or similar process manager in production
- Configure PM2 with cluster mode for multi-core utilization
- Set up database connection retry logic with exponential backoff
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for external service calls
- Use Redis for caching frequently accessed data with appropriate TTL
- Invalidate cache BEFORE write operations to prevent stale data
- Document API endpoints with JSDoc or OpenAPI/Swagger
- Add request/response examples in API documentation

#### Monorepo & Workspace Verification

- Before using pnpm/npm filters, read package.json to verify exact `name` field (folder name ≠ package name)
- Run `pnpm build` or `npm run build` early when modifying TypeScript to catch type errors before extensive changes
- When working with linked packages (`link:` or `workspace:` protocol), check that shared dependencies have compatible versions
- Use `pnpm why <dependency>` or `npm ls <dependency>` to diagnose version conflicts before debugging type errors
- When seeing "types are incompatible" errors with external libraries, investigate dependency version mismatches FIRST
- If forced to use `as any` for version mismatches, document the reason with a comment explaining the version conflict

### Never

- Put business logic in route handlers (always use service layer)
- Skip input validation or trust user input
- Use console.log for logging (always use Pino logger)
- Return raw database models in API responses (use DTOs or response transformers)
- Hard-code configuration values (always use environment variables)
- Skip error handling or suppress errors silently
- Perform long-running operations synchronously in request handlers
- Make synchronous external API calls in request/response cycle (queue them)
- Expose internal errors or stack traces to API consumers in production
- Skip testing for critical functionality (auth, payments, data mutations)
- Use synchronous file I/O operations (use async fs methods)
- Ignore security best practices (helmet, CORS, rate limiting, input sanitization)
- Use blocking operations in the event loop
- Skip database migrations and modify schema manually
- Deploy without PM2 or process manager
- Run Express in production without clustering
- Use in-memory session store in production
- Store sensitive data in plain text (passwords, API keys, tokens)
- Ignore memory leaks or performance degradation
- Skip graceful shutdown handling
- Use weak JWT secrets or predictable token generation
- Trust client-side validation alone (always validate server-side)
- Mix callback and promise patterns in same codebase
- Use deprecated Express middleware or patterns
- Skip correlation IDs for request tracking
- Deploy without health check endpoints
- Ignore database connection pool limits
- Use unbounded array operations on user input
- Skip error logging with stack traces and context

#### Monorepo Anti-Patterns

- Use folder names as pnpm/npm filter names without verifying package.json `name` field
- Make extensive TypeScript changes without running the build first
- Ignore "types are incompatible" errors without checking dependency versions across workspace packages
- Add `as any` type assertions without documenting the reason (must include comment about version mismatch)
- Assume `--filter <folder-name>` will work (always verify exact package name from package.json)

### Prefer

- Service layer architecture over fat route handlers
- Async/await over callbacks or raw promise chains
- Joi validation schemas over manual validation logic
- Custom error middleware over try-catch in every route
- Async error wrapper utility over repetitive try-catch blocks
- Pino child loggers with context over root logger everywhere

- Mock repository.create() to return created user
- Assert transaction committed
- Test error handling with transaction rollback

Mocking patterns:
- Mock Bull queue: jest.mock('bull', () => mockQueue)
- Mock Redis client with jest.fn() methods
- Mock external API calls with jest.spyOn()
- Use jest.resetAllMocks() in beforeEach

Running tests:
- npm test: run all tests
- npm test -- --coverage: generate coverage report
- npm test -- --watch: watch mode for development
- Configure CI/CD to run tests and check coverage thresholds

### Example 9: Verify monorepo package names and build before changes

**Task**: Build a specific Express API package in a pnpm/npm workspace monorepo

**Input**: Build the API package located in apps/api

**Output**:
Pre-flight verification (BEFORE any changes):
- Read apps/api/package.json to find exact `name` field
- Folder name often differs from package name (e.g., "apps/api" → "@myorg/api")
- Test filter: `pnpm --filter @myorg/api list` (should return exactly 1 result)
- If zero results: package name is wrong, re-check package.json

Build verification (BEFORE making changes):
- Run full build first: `pnpm build` to verify baseline compiles
- Note any existing errors - these aren't your fault
- Only then start making modifications

Common monorepo naming patterns:
- Folder: apps/api → Package: @myorg/api or myorg-api (NOT "api")
- Folder: packages/core → Package: @myorg/core (NOT "core")
- Folder: apps/admin → Package: @myorg/admin or myorg-admin

After changes:
- Run `pnpm build` again to verify no regressions
- Run `pnpm lint` for code style
- Run targeted build: `pnpm --filter @myorg/api build`

### Example 10: Diagnose and fix linked package dependency conflicts

**Task**: Fix TypeScript "types are incompatible" errors when using linked workspace packages

**Input**: Database client shows type error like "Type 'Command' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Command'"

**Output**:
Diagnosis (ALWAYS do this first - it's usually NOT a code problem):
- This error pattern typically means VERSION MISMATCH between packages
- Check versions: `pnpm why <problematic-type-package>`
- Look for multiple versions (e.g., 4.9.0 in one package, 4.12.0 in another)
- Linked packages (`link:` or `workspace:` protocol) can have different dependency versions

Root cause pattern:
- Package A depends on library@3.5.0 → uses internal-type@4.9.0
- Package B depends on library@3.6.0 → uses internal-type@4.12.0
- TypeScript sees different type definitions, reports incompatibility

Fix Option 1 - Version alignment (PREFERRED):
- Edit root package.json, add pnpm.overrides (or npm.overrides):
  ```json
  "pnpm": {
    "overrides": {
      "<conflicting-package>": "^x.y.z"
    }
  }
  ```
- Run `pnpm install` to regenerate lock file
- Rebuild all packages: `pnpm build`

Fix Option 2 - Type assertion (LAST RESORT):
- Add assertion: `await (client as any).method(params)`
- Add eslint-disable: `// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`
- DOCUMENT the reason: `// Type assertion: version mismatch between linked packages (@smithy/types 4.9.0 vs 4.12.0)`

Prevention:
- Keep library versions aligned across all workspace packages
- Use package manager overrides for critical shared dependencies
- Run `pnpm build` before AND after changes to catch issues early
